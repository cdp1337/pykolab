== /!\ Test Execution /!\ ==

Do NOT execute the tests against a production environment.

In case you've missed the previous statement;

Do NOT execute the tests against a production environment.

== To Execute Tests ==

A configuration section [testing] can be added to /etc/kolab/kolab.conf, which
may contain the following key/value pairs:

  admin_login = "string"

    Set this to the login name of a (global, cross-domain) Cyrus IMAP manager.

  admin_password = "string"

    This would be... the password for the aforementioned login.

  server = "hostname-or-ip-address"

    A server we can execute the testing against.

  users = [ ]

    A list of dictionaries, each dictionary representing one user with the
    following attributes:

      givenname
      sn
      domain
      password

    All tests assume %(givenname)s@%(domain)s as the email address corresponding
    to the user.

    Don't forget that using different domains for the users implies you have set
    up the Kolab server accordingly.

Now that you have this information, the following might just start testing;

  python ./kolabtest.py --debug 9 --conf /path/to/conf --suite zpush --use-imap
